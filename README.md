> **⚠️ Experimental**: This project is under active development. APIs may change without notice. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Why Kausality?

We deployed a cluster with 1000 B200 GPU nodes — the expensive kind 💸. Burn-in was done carefully — nodes scaled up manually in the AWS console, slowly, deliberately, correctly. It worked.

A few days later, we rolled out an update of our controllers. One composition change removed an unrelated AWS add-on. That was enough. Terraform was triggered. Terraform reconciled the cluster. The desired state said: far fewer than 1000 nodes. Terraform did exactly what it was told.

**Reality had drifted. Intent had not been recorded.**

The system had no concept of *why* the cluster looked the way it did — only what the declarative snapshot said. No bug. Hundreds of nodes gone. An expensive incident 💸.

This story is about Terraform, but the same applies to Crossplane, Pulumi, or any declarative IaC tool. It's a foundational problem: **declarative systems converge to declared state, not intended state.** And we all want these systems to work without a human in the loop.

The downstream IaC system applies blindly. It doesn't know about intent — it applies what is declared. If the latter changes although it was intended as a no-op, disaster hits your fleet. Automated. Fast. Disastrous.

This is the class of failure Kausality is built to prevent.

**Kausality captures causality, ownership, and intent:**
- Which system is allowed to change what
- Which changes imply reconciliation
- Which state must never be "helpfully" converged away

> If your infrastructure can't explain why something exists, eventually it will delete it.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Kausality

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kausality-io/kausality.git
cd kausality

# Install with Helm
helm install kausality ./charts/kausality \
  --namespace kausality-system \
  --create-namespace
```

### 2. Create a Policy

Tell Kausality what to watch. Save this as `policy.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kausality.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kausality
metadata:
  name: watch-apps
spec:
  resources:
    - apiGroups: ["apps"]
      resources: ["deployments", "replicasets"]
  mode: log  # Detect and warn, don't block
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f policy.yaml
```

### 3. See It In Action

Create a Deployment and wait for it to stabilize:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:1.24
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx
```

Now cause drift by directly modifying the ReplicaSet:

```bash
# Get the ReplicaSet name
RS=$(kubectl get rs -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

# Directly modify the ReplicaSet (this is drift!)
kubectl patch rs $RS --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"replicas":3}}'
```

You'll see a warning:

```
Warning: [kausality] drift detected: controller updating ReplicaSet while parent Deployment is stable
```

The controller will try to "fix" this back to the original replica count — and Kausality detects that as drift too, because the Deployment spec hasn't changed.

### 4. Enable Drift Logging (Optional)

To see detailed DriftReports, enable a backend:

```bash
# Log backend - outputs DriftReports as YAML to stdout
helm upgrade kausality ./charts/kausality \
  --namespace kausality-system \
  --set backend.enabled=true

# View the drift logs
kubectl logs -n kausality-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=backend-log -f
```

**TUI backend** - interactive terminal UI for real-time drift monitoring:

```bash
helm upgrade kausality ./charts/kausality \
  --namespace kausality-system \
  --set backendTui.enabled=true

# Attach to the TUI
kubectl attach -n kausality-system deploy/kausality-backend-tui -it
```

## What is Drift?

**Drift** = a controller making changes when nothing requested that change.

Kausality distinguishes between:

| Scenario | What Happens | Is it Drift? |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| You update a Deployment | Controller creates new ReplicaSet | **No** — expected reconciliation |
| Cloud resource changes externally | Controller updates child resources | **Yes** — no spec change triggered this |
| You directly edit a ReplicaSet | Controller reverts your change | **Yes** — controller acting without spec change |
| Software update changes controller behavior | Controller re-reconciles differently | **Yes** — silent change |

### How Detection Works

Kausality tracks who updates what:

1. **Parent status updates** → records the controller's identity
2. **Child spec updates** → checks if this is the same controller
3. **Stable parent** (`generation == observedGeneration`) + **controller update** = **drift**

Different actors (you running `kubectl`, HPA, GitOps tools) are *not* drift — they start new causal chains.

---

## Configuration

### Kausality CRD

The `Kausality` CRD defines what to monitor and how:

```yaml
apiVersion: kausality.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kausality
metadata:
  name: production-policy
spec:
  # What resources to watch
  resources:
    - apiGroups: ["apps"]
      resources: ["deployments", "replicasets", "statefulsets"]
    - apiGroups: ["example.com"]
      resources: ["*"]
      excluded: ["unwanted-resource"]

  # Which namespaces (optional — defaults to all)
  namespaces:
    names: ["production", "staging"]
    # Or use selectors:
    # selector:
    #   matchLabels:
    #     env: production
    excluded: ["kube-system"]

  # Filter by object labels (optional)
  objectSelector:
    matchLabels:
      managed-by: kausality

  # Mode: log or enforce
  mode: log

  # Override mode for specific cases
  overrides:
    - namespaces: ["production"]
      mode: enforce
```

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `log` | Detect drift, return warnings, allow the mutation |
| `enforce` | Detect drift, **block** mutations without approval |

### Approvals (Enforce Mode)

In `enforce` mode, you can approve specific drift:

```yaml
# On the parent resource
metadata:
  annotations:
    kausality.io/approvals: |
      [{"apiVersion":"apps/v1","kind":"ReplicaSet","name":"nginx-abc123","mode":"always"}]
```

Approval modes:
- `always` — permanently approved
- `once` — consumed after first use
- `generation` — valid until parent generation changes

---

```

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Webhook** | Intercepts mutations, detects drift, adds warnings/blocks |
| **Controller** | Watches Kausality CRDs, configures webhook rules and RBAC |
| **Backend** | Receives DriftReports for logging/alerting (optional) |

### Lifecycle Phases

Kausality handles resource lifecycle:

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Initializing** | Allow all changes (resource setting up) |
| **Initialized** | Drift detection active |
| **Deleting** | Allow all changes (cleanup) |

Initialization is detected via:
- `kausality.io/phase: initialized` annotation
- `Initialized=True` or `Ready=True` conditions
- `observedGeneration` matching `generation`

### Trace Labels

Attach metadata to trace entries for correlation:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    kausality.io/trace-ticket: "JIRA-123"
    kausality.io/trace-pr: "567"
```

---

## Installation Options

### Helm (Recommended)

```bash
helm install kausality ./charts/kausality \
  --namespace kausality-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set backend.enabled=true  # Enable drift logging
```

### As a Library (Generic Control Plane)

Kausality can be embedded directly into custom apiservers built with `k8s.io/apiserver`:

```go
import "github.com/kausality-io/kausality/pkg/admission"

handler := admission.NewHandler(admission.Config{
    Client:         client,
    Log:            logger,
    PolicyResolver: policy.NewStaticResolver(kausalityv1alpha1.ModeEnforce),
})
```

See [`cmd/example-generic-control-plane/`](cmd/example-generic-control-plane/) for a complete working example with embedded etcd.

### With cert-manager

```bash
helm install kausality ./charts/kausality \
  --namespace kausality-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set certificates.selfSigned.enabled=false \
  --set certificates.certManager.enabled=true \
  --set certificates.certManager.issuerRef.name=my-issuer \
  --set certificates.certManager.issuerRef.kind=ClusterIssuer
```

### Key Helm Values

| Value | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `backend.enabled` | `false` | Deploy the log backend (YAML to stdout) |
| `backendTui.enabled` | `false` | Deploy the TUI backend (interactive terminal) |
| `controller.enabled` | `true` | Auto-manage webhook config from CRDs |
| `certificates.selfSigned.enabled` | `true` | Use Helm-generated certs |
| `logging.level` | `info` | Log level (debug, info, warn, error) |

See [values.yaml](charts/kausality/values.yaml) for all options.
